### NLP-Suite-Backend

This is the project that I did in my senior year. It is the NodeJS powered backend part of the project **NLP-Suite**.

This project has three parts:

1. _Frontend_: The UI with which the users will interact. This UI will make use of NodeJS powered backend API for registering and handling user's information.
2. _Backend on NodeJS_: The backend which handles all users and their information with proper authentication. This is the backend that is powered by NodeJS.
3. _Backend on Flask_: The backend where trained models are deployed. This is the backend that is powered by Flask.
